#developwithpassion_fakes-rspec

This is a library to aid in the usage of [developwithpassion_fakes](http://github.com/developwithpassion/developwithpassion_fakes) when using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec). It "basically" just adds 2 convienience matcher methods: 

* have_received
* have_received_occurences 

##Installation
```bash
gem install developwithpassion_fakes-rspec
```
Or (preferably using bundler), in your gemfile:

```ruby
source "http://rubygems.org"
gem 'developwithpassion_fakes-rspec'
```

When you install the gem it will install the rspec gem also, so you will immediately ready to go.

##Usage

##Determining whether a call was made

###Irrespective of arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello) #true
end
```
###With a specific set of arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received(:hello,"World") #true
  fake.should have_received(:hello,"Other") #false
end
```
Remember, that because it is just a matcher, to negate the matcher you can use the should_not qualifier to do the opposite:

###Determine whether a call was not made with a specific set of arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was not made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should_not have_received(:hello,"Other") #true
end
```

##Determining that a call was made a certain number of times

###Irrespective of arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received_occurences(once,:hello) #true
end
```

###Caring about arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should have_received_occurences(once,:hello,"World") #true
  fake.should have_received_occurences(once,:hello,"Earth") #false
end
```

Remember, that because it is just a matcher, to negate the matcher you can use the should_not qualifier to do the opposite:

###Determine whether a call was not made a specific number of times with a specific set of arguments:
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")

  fake.should_not have_received_occurences(twice,:hello,"World") #true
  fake.should_not have_received_occurences(twice,:hello) #true
end
```

The first argument to have_received_occurences just needs to be an item that responds to the method: is_satisfied_by(count).

The library adds a couple of convenience factory methods to the ExampleGroup class,to create the match specifications:

* once
* twice
* at_least_once
* at_least_twice
* at_most_once
* at_most_twice
* at_least(times)
* at_most(times)
* exactly(times)
* occurs(match_block) - Where match_block is a proc/lambda that matches the signature lambda{|number| bool}

An example of using the occurs method would be as follows:

###Determine whether a call was not made between a certain number of times
```ruby
it "should be able to determine if a call was made on a fake" do
  the_fake = fake
  fake.hello("World")
  fake.hello("Again")

  fake.should have_received_occurences(occurs(|number| (1..3) === number),:hello) #true
end
```
